# Rock_paper_scissors
This program was designed to allow the user to play a game
of rock paper scissors against a computer. To accomplish this 
I made use of prompt to get the users input, and a switch statement
to check whether or not they won each round. The program also
made use of conditional statements.

I mostly struggled with the switch statement, because it took
me a while to remember the proper way to write each case. Once
I got that figured out though, it was not terribly difficult
to finish the rest of the project.

If/when I revisit this, I would like to clean up the UI and make 
it look a lot more appealing.
